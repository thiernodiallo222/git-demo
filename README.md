# git-demo
## This is just a demo
##### As a biginner, it is easier to use the https protocol over the ssh to securely and easily push stuff in github
##### One can use the following command: git remote 
##### if you have used the ssh protocol, you can always change it by using the following command: git remote set-url origin https://...
##### to check what url you are using, you can type: git remote -v
##### push your reposetory by typing: git push -u origin master
##### or git push -u origin <reposetory name>
##### to make a branch instead of the master branc, type: git checkout -b <nameOfNewBranch>
