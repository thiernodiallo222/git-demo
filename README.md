###### This is just a demo
 As a biginner, it is easier to use the https protocol over the ssh to securely and easily push stuff in github
###### One can use the following command: 
###### git remote 
###### To add a url, just type in: git remote add origin https://github.com/userName/reposetoryName.git
###### if you have used the ssh protocol, you can always change it by using the following command: 
###### git remote set-url origin https://github.com/userName/reposetoryName.git
###### to check what url you are using, you can type: 
###### git remote -v
###### push your reposetory by typing: 
###### git push -u origin master
 or
###### git push -u origin reposertoryName
###### to make a branch instead out of the master branche, type: 
###### git checkout -b reposeoryName
